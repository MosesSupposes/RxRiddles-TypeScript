# Original project

The original project comes from [RxRiddles](https://github.com/vanniktech/RxRiddles) for Kotlin written by [Niklas Baudy](https://github.com/vanniktech). This project is meant to be an RxJS/TypeScript re-write of the original riddles.

# RxRiddles - TypeScript

This repository contains some riddles for [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) to help you learn and master RxJS. I'm currently re-writing original riddles from Niklas's project.

Each riddle is in a single file with an accompanying unit test that will check your implementation. Next to the unit test, I have also put up my solution. Solutions are very similar in some cases to operators used by RxJava, but sometimes they differ a lot.
 
Please note that there are multiple ways to achieve and solve the riddles, but usually there's a dedicated operator or function that I wanted to show you.

The riddles are not sorted in any real preference in the original project and Niklas plans to keep it that way. I'll try to keep them 1:1 as much as possible since there may be differences in Rx implementations.

### Contributing

I'm very open to having some more riddles. Especially some complex common use cases. In case you want to contribute create an issue and let's talk.

I want every riddle to be unique and have as little duplication as possible while also having some actual real-world use case for each riddle in mind. Something you can relate to and hopefully use in your everyday life.
